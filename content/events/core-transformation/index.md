## üìÑ ABSTRACT

**Discovering Your Best Self Through Core Transformation**

We all have a inner core that represents our highest potential. It's where our deepest wisdom, values and vision reside. But so often this core self gets buried under limiting beliefs, fears and traumatic memories. Core Transformation is a process that helps you access and align with your fundamental goodness.

## üë£ BASIC STEPS OF CORE TRANSFORMATION BASED ON WORK OF CONNIRAE & TAMARA ANDREAS

- Choose Thought, behavior or feeling you would like to change or transform.

- Step inside the situation and locate the sensation of the part responsible for the deed.

- Thank the part for establishing communication and ask the part: ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Wait for a response.

- Thank the part for communicating with you and ask the part to step or breathe into the outcome of want: ‚ÄúWhat it is like to already have X fully and completely.‚Äù

- As the part is experiencing X ask the part: ‚ÄúWhat do you want through this X that is even deeper or more important‚Äù

- Repeat the questions form paragraph 4 and 5 till you reach core state.

- Reverse the chain, till original thought or behavior. Observe the change. When you already have the [core state] fully and completely, how does already having the [core state] enrich the experience of X? When you already have the [core state] fully and completely, how does already having the [core state] enrich the experience of XX? When you already have the [core state] fully and completely, how does already having the [core state] enrich the experience of XXXX..? When you already have the [core state] fully and completely, how does already having the [core state] enrich the experience of Your original state?

- Integrate the part into whole being

- Transform past and future experiences with Core state.

- Use Core state to amend relationship with your people.

Developed by Connirae and Tamara Andreas, Core Transformation guides you through a structured sequence of questions and visualization exercises. By gently investigating your core state, it allows you to release old negative patterns and align more fully with your true nature.

While it may sound simple, the transformations enabled by this process can be life-changing. By getting to the root of our fears and false beliefs, Core Transformation lets our inner wisdom reframe our experiences in a more empowering way. 

If you're ready to uncover your best self and move past self-limiting patterns, I highly recommend exploring Core Transformation. Even just a few sessions can help you re-connect with your core state and start living at your highest potential. The journey inward reveals we all have goodness and wisdom inside, if we know how to access it.
