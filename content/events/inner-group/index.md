> "These are gamblers ready to risk what they can't afford for what they can't have, you're selling the world's rarest commodity: certainty, in an uncertain world." - *Walter Abrams in Two for the money*

I use my time for 🙌 learning and sharing. If you would like to participate in practice first contact me through [form](/en/#contact) with your area of interest, expertise and your webpage.

## 🙌 I OFFER ELICITATE YOUR TIMELINE, DECISION STRATEGY, GUT FEELING AND HELP INTEGRATE POSITIVE CHANGES.

It will involve interactively eliciting your personal timeline through visualization and spatial mapping techniques. We will identify problematic memories that may be holding you back as well as visionary goals we are working towards. Through proven methods, we can clear emotional charges from past events and bring your desired future outcomes into clearer focus.

In addition to timeline work, we'll elicit your core values, motivations and decision making patterns. Together we will integrate supportive changes into your timeline and inner framework that align with your authentic self. Our goal is not to dictate changes, but to facilitate your own inner wisdom and resources for transformational change.

Please get in touch if you’re ready to unlock greater self-awareness and take control of your inner world. Let’s walk through your timeline together and build a future defined by your true values, gifts, and vision.
