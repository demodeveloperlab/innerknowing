> ‚ÄúYour body is like the quiet talker with the most important thing to say.‚Äù

## üìÑ ABSTRACT

Your body is your closest companion. It is always with you, experiencing everything you do. Yet many of us feel disconnected from our bodies, not really listening to what it is trying to tell us. What if we started having a conversation with our body, listening to what it has to say?

You can speak directly to your body, aloud or silently. Tell your body lovingly, "I am listening" or "I am here for you." Ask what it most needs right now - rest, movement, nourishment? Thank your body for all it does for you each day - breathing, pumping blood, making energy. Send gratitude to every organ and cell. Your body appreciates being recognized and cared for.

Making a practice of body conversations can strengthen your connection with yourself. It builds self-understanding as your body reveals its needs and wisdom. You may find long-held tensions beginning to unwind. Old injuries can finally heal. You come home to yourself, living in greater alignment and harmony.

## üë£ BASIC STEPS OF TALKING TO YOUR BODY BASED ON WORK OF VLADIMIR KLIMSA

1. Scanning for areas of body with messages - sensation. 

2. Ask the body to chose most urgent message - sensation.

3. Ask the sensation - part of the body for positive intention of the message.

4. If the message was to stop or change some behavior ask for behavior positive intent.
  
5. Ask the part of the body to creatively generate 3 most accessible, immediate and efficient behaviors which would satisfy previous behavior positive intent.
   
6. Ask the part of the body to select best choice and try it on in the future.

7. Ask the part of the body to take responsibility for new behavior. And generate muscle memory playing new behavior in different contexts and times.

8. Promise to your body that you will be attentive to it's messages.
