## üìÑ ABSTRACT

Gut feeling, Feeling of knowing, Metamemory, Tip of the tongue phenomenon are all descriptions of access to kinesthetic sensation of knowing attached to some event in our life. We will explore how to elicit the state of inner knowing and through simple exercises program out mind to experience this state more often in our life.

### POEM

It starts as a subtle stir in your core - a fluttering that softly beckons. As if your soul is tapping you on the shoulder, trying to get your attention. Ignore it, and it will keep tapping, a bit more insistently. 

When you finally pause to listen, it speaks in sensations, not words. Knowing feels like a golden glow warming you from the inside out. It resonates deep in your bones like a tuning fork struck.

There is a rightness to it. An unmistakable sense of truth ringing clear as a bell. This inner knowing bypasses your thinking mind completely, anchoring you in stillness. Here, there are no second guesses, just quiet conviction.

Knowing feels like a long exhale, as you relax into its guidance. A release of tension as you surrender to what is. Now is the time to take one step forward, then another. 

The path illuminated before you is unquestionable. You feel held by the light of understanding. Knowing feels like coming home and hearing the click of the lock. Like a key turning in your soul.
