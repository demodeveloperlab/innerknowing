## ‚ùì THE BASIC CLEAN LANGUAGE QUESTIONS SET BY DAVID GROVE

The variables X and Y are placeholders for the individual's spoken or nonverbal expressions in these questions.

- (And) what kind of X (is that X)?
- (And) is there anything else about X?
- (And) where is X? or (And) whereabouts is X?
- (And) that‚Äôs X like what? (this gets you the metaphor that you can then explore)
- (And) is there a relationship between X and Y?
- (And) when X, what happens to Y?
- (And) then what happens? or (And) what happens next?
- (And) what happens just before X?
- (And) where could X come from?
- (And) what would X like to have happen?
- (And) what needs to happen for X?
- (And) can X (happen)?
