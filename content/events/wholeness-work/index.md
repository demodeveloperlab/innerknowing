## üìÑ ABSTRACT

A core idea is that our sense of a separate "self" or ego is created by unconscious contractions of consciousness called "small I's." These exist as locations in space that can be sensed internally. 

Dissolving these small I's through a gentle process of merging them withAwareness leads to greater inner freedom, wellbeing, emotional intelligence, and ability to transform life issues.

## üë£ BASIC STEPS OF WHOLENESS WORK BASED ON WORK OF CONNIRAE ANDREAS

1. Eliciting a feeling response. 

2. Finding the chain of I's associated with it.
  
3. Inviting them to dissolve into Awareness. 
   
4. This releases limiting beliefs and transforms the original issue.

## üë®‚Äçü¶≤ VLADIMIR KLIMSA WILL BE OFFERING SPACE FOR SAFE PRACTICE

- I will use open source multiplatform voice, video conferencing and instant messaging applications for the Web platform, Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS and Android. [Jitsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitsi). You don't need to install anything.
- I'll ask you to have your book Coming to wholeness at your reach with paper and pencil near by.
- I will not collect or ask for any personal data. You might create shortname of your choice and call your issues A or B, use symbols or metaphors.
- I highly recommend that you create any secure email account which allows you to redirect emails to your normal accounts. I am using gmx.com
- As the practice group is held for participants to practice their skills relying on the feedback, I will ask you to unblock video and audio.

If you would like to participate in the practice, please first contact me via the [contact form](/en/#contact) with information about your area of interest, expertise and website.
